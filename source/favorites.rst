Our favorites
=============

Welcome to my favorites page. 

There have been many movies out this past year but few have been 
good enough to see in my opinion. One movie out did the rest and
that movie was the live action version of Beauty and the Beast.

Disney's *Beauty and the Beast* is a classic film. I was a tad
skeptical when I heard that a live action version was coming out
but this film proved to be a spectacular one.

Before I tell you exactly why I liked this film so much, lets 
compare the original version to the new version.

Why the 2017 Version Was So Good
--------------------------------

Disney did an excellent job making the 2017 version of Beauty and
the Beast new and fresh all while keeping the same classic story.
The CGI, acting, and music were all fantastic. My favorite new 
aspect of this film was how funny it was. I was not expecting
there to be that much humor in it but I was happily surprised.
I would definitely recommend this film to people of all ages.
