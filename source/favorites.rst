Our favorites
=============

Welcome to my favorites page. 

There have been many movies out this past year but few have been 
good enough to see in my opinion. One movie out did the rest and
that movie was the live action version of Beauty and the Beast.

Disney's *Beauty and the Beast* is a classic film. I was a tad
skeptical when I heard that a live action version was coming out
but this film proved to be a spectacular one.

Before I tell you exactly why I liked this film so much, lets 
compare the original version to the new version.
