*Description:*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two New Yorkers fight the battle of the sexes to a standstill (without 
entirely realizing it) in this romantic comedy. Andie (Kate Hudson) is a 
young journalist who longs to cover political stories, but in the meantime
she finds herself writing for a women's magazine called Composure, where 
her editor Lana Jong (Bebe Neuwirth) has her writing a fluffy advice
column. After hearing of the latest dating laments of her
relationship-challenged friend Michelle (Kathryn Hahn), Andie sells Lana 
on the idea of writing a piece on the things women do to alienate the men 
they love, which she'll demonstrate by winning and then driving away a
man in a mere ten days. Meanwhile, Ben (Matthew McConaughey) is an
advertising man who wants to land a prestige diamond account at his
firm. Ben is competing with his pals, Spears (Michael Michele) and
Green (Shalom Harlow), for the assignment, so Ben tells his boss 
Phillip Warren (Robert Klein) that he's the man for the job because 
he understands the fair sex so well he can make any woman fall for 
him in less than two weeks. As fate would have it, Andie and Ben end
up choosing one another for their mutual assignments, with neither 
knowing about each other's secret agenda as Ben strives to hold on 
to Andie while she does everything in her power to annoy him. How to 
Lose a Guy in 10 Days was loosely based on the self-help book of the 
same name (subtitled The Universal Don't of Dating) written by 
Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi.
