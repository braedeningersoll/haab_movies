Angela's Favorites
==================

As a member of Generation X, I tend to enjoy the older movies. I have had my
share of relationships and my favorites reflect those women who haven't
quite gotten the marriage scene down yet, much like myself.  Below are a 
few of my favorite movies with strong leading ladies.

**Directed by:** Donald Price

**Run Time:** 1hr 56min

**MPAA Rating:** Rated PG-13 for some sex-related material

HAAB Review: How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, is absolutely my favorite
movie.  I love the chemistry between the leading actors Kate Hudson, and 
Mathew McConaughey.  This story makes you laugh, cry, and leaves you 
wanting a sequel.  The whole idea of what common mistakes woman make to 
lose a guy would have worked if it had not been for those sneaky, 
co-workers from the advertising firm.  You can't help but fall in love with
this couple.

HAAB Review: The movie Chicago, just makes me want to get out of my seat 
and dance.  Yes, the idea of killing cheating men also intrigues me a 
little.  This musical has once a Broadway hit that needed to be in 
everyone's home. The way the dancing tells the story is unbelievable.  You 
just must see this move.

A forty-something preschool teacher looks to the personals for a change of
pace and a relationship, with hilarious results. Cited from IMDb

**Starring:** Diane Lane, John Cusack, Elizabeth Perkins.

**Directed by:** Gary David Goldberg

**Run Time:** 1hr 38min

**MPAA Rating:** Rated PG-13 for sexual content

HAAB Review: Must Love Dogs, is my go to movie when I have recently broken 
up with a boyfriend.  As a woman in her mid-forties, I apricate the
storyline from the aspect of an older dating generation. When I first saw
this movie the dating world had just been introduced to online profiles.
How, Prospective men and woman can decide by looks alone if they feel 
someone would be compatible.  The movie is so realistic it highlights how
Mr. right can be right under your nose but you still choose Mr. wrong a few
times first.
