Three thousand years ago, the greatest sailors in the world voyaged across
the vast Pacific, discovering the many islands of Oceania. But then, for a
millennium, their voyages stopped - and no one knows exactly why. From Walt

film about an adventurous teenager who sails out on a daring mission to 
save her people. During her journey, Moana (voice of Auli'i Cravalho) meets
the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson), who guides her in her
quest to become a master wayfinder. Together, they sail across the open 
ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous monsters and
impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills the ancient quest of   
her ancestors and discovers the one thing she's always sought: her own 
identity..
