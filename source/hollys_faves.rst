------------------

Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a city of various animals, a newbie bunny cop (Ginnifer Goodwin) and a cynical 
con artist fox (Jason Bateman) must join forces to uncover a mystery. 

**Starring:** Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, and Tommy Chong.

**Directed by:** Byron Howard

**Run Time:** 1hr 48min

**MPAA Rating:** Rated PG, some thematic elements, rude humor and action

**HAAB Review:** I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It's not only cute but it has such
an inspirational message that I really like. Maybe it's the inner kid in me, but 
Pixar and Disney never disappoints when it comes to their animated films. I love
all the detail that they put into this film, from the different habitats to the 
various animals and even the smallest detail (that Mickey Mouse head on the wall!).
Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde make such a great duo and the running gags in it are just
a joy. You definitely won't be disappointed in watching this kids' movie!

Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 On the way to her family's new home, Chihiro (Daveigh Chase) and her parents make
 a small pit stop only for her parents to get turned into pigs! The 10 year old has
 to make her way around the world of the spirits and gods in hopes of saving her 
 parents.

**Starring:** Daveigh Chase, Suzanne Pleshette, and Miyu Irino.

**Directed by:** Hayao Miyazaki

**Run Time:** 2hr 5min

**MPAA Rating:** Rated PG, for some scary elements

**HAAB Review:** Since a child, watching this movie has always been so magical. 
It's such a beautiful film, both the animation and the soundtrack go together so
perfectly. Miyazaki takes us on a journey away from the living and into the Japanese
spiritual world. The breathtaking art, music and plot line is enough to captivate you
in a way that most animated films cannot.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)
------------------
.. image:: /images/guardians2.jpg
    :width: 50%

Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Guardians of the Galaxy must find a way to keep their newfound family together
as they work to find out Peter Quill's (Chris Pratt) father. 

**Starring:** Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper,
and Michael Rooker.

**Directed by:** James Gunn

**Run Time:** 2hr 16min

**MPAA Rating:** Rated PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action,
and for some language.

**HAAB Review:** I personally enjoyed the first installment of this series but the
second is probably my favorite of the two. It might have to be because I think 
Baby Groot is such a cutie, but I also enjoyed the character development in this.
We get to see more of Quill's parentage and how everyone deals with each other since
the last movie. This movie definitely hit me in the feels as the story progressed and 
I like that in a movie. It left me wanting to watch more as everything unfolded.
I also really liked the selection of music in this, very fitting for all the scenes.
The non-stop jokes and humor was also greatly appreciated.
