**HAAB Review:** Transformers: The Last Knight, the fifth installment of the Transformers film series by Michael Bay, will hopefully be its last. To call this movie terrible would be unfair though not entirely untrue, however, all this film has to offer is more of the same. As in every Transformers film so far we open with quick refresher to establish the fallout of the previous film and the dynamic between the human race, the Autobots, and the Decepticons. Then insert an overdose of robot juggernaut fights and inexplicable explosions that is then followed by a mysterious secret of the Transformers of either their past or the dubious actions of the Decepticons that will inevitably turn out to be a red herring of their actual plans. These evil plans are thwarted by our heroes, though most notably by Optimus Prime, the original and toy sales team's favorite. And despite the repitious plot over the span of 5 movies, there is still an apparent disregard for story length. The film, seems to try to reinvent itself TWICE during the film which in turn increases the run time exponentially leading to the ridiculous 2 hour and 29 minute run time. What The Last Knight did well was its creation of excting fight sequences that are plan fun action. What the Last Knight did poorly was innovating its storyline, sticking to a single coherrent plot line, and it failed to leave racist caracitures out of the film.
